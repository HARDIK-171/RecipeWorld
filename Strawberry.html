    <p>Strawberry custard is a simple and delicious dessert made by combining fresh strawberries with a smooth, creamy custard base. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
       <li><b> Strawberries</b></h2>: Fresh strawberries are ideal for the best flavor. They add natural sweetness and a slight tang.</li>
        <li><b>Custard Powder</b> (optional): Vanilla custard powder is often used to thicken and flavor the custard, though some recipes may use eggs and vanilla extract instead.</li>
       <li><b> Milk</b>: The base of the custard; whole milk or cream gives the best creamy texture.</li>
       <li><b> Sugar</b>: Adds sweetness, adjustable based on your preference.</li>
       </ul>
       <h2> Preparation:</h2>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the Custard</b>: In a pot, warm the milk and gradually add the custard powder mixed with a bit of cold milk to avoid lumps. Stir continuously until it thickens.</li>
        <li><b>Sweeten the Custard</b>: Add sugar and continue to stir until it dissolves. Cook for a few more minutes until the custard reaches your desired consistency.</li>
        <li><b>Combine with Strawberries</b>: Allow the custard to cool slightly, then fold in sliced strawberries. You can serve it warm or chilled.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Serving Suggestions:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Garnish with extra strawberries, whipped cream, or a sprig of mint.</li>
        <li>Serve it in bowls or glasses for a nice presentation.</li>
        </ul>
        This dessert is refreshing, especially when chilled, and makes a lovely treat during warm months. It's perfect for strawberry lovers!</p>
